mismatch1: trump doesnt need giuliani to look foolish ... ...
mismatch2: using jags would not insulate the federal gov't from potential civil and/or criminal liability .
mismatch3: wonder how our military moms are feeling now ? if war do n't get them their own potus will poison them at home !
mismatch4: and even if it was a law - is in charge of the executive branch of government & can direct ice not to employ resources to pursue enforcement of
mismatch5: what a brazen crook -- and a cheapskate , too !
mismatch6: but it was ok for hilary to run for president while she was under federal investigation ? got it ...
mismatch7: now pay us tax payers back ! ! !
mismatch8: let me guess ... trump\ 's fault ?
mismatch9: i hope you will share this line of questioning with your former colleagues in hopes that they will pursue it !
mismatch10: using fake crime , job loss and fear to distract from the truth trump and many of his minions are racist , pure and simple !
mismatch11: al ! get this to your senator friends and beg them to ask these questions ! albie wan , you ’ re our only hope !
mismatch12: congress has the power to set the elections -- not the president
mismatch13: clinton would have unleashed the third world war .
mismatch14: she\ 's on the side that will get votes only does not care about you . she\ 's in it for herself like all the other government bums .
mismatch15: liberal judges gone wild . the supreme court must stop these lower level judges from making rulings that affect the entire country .
mismatch16: compare all this to free shs nationwide .
mismatch17: it ’ s okay trump has signed a executive order allowing families to stay together . something obama let slide
mismatch18: not as embarrassing as if that person married their cousin . that would be mortifying .
mismatch19: you know who he is going to throw under the bus for this policy.. the keebler elf himself !
mismatch20: ethics is for others , not this administration . gotv voteblue2018
mismatch21: a bullet between those fascist christian eyes is what he deserves .
mismatch22: feeling so confident of his skill of horse trading the president of ruling party of india . is it not the greatest day of indian democracy ... ?
mismatch23: i have the next title for my stage play ... . '' it happened under obama ''
mismatch24: don\'t let the door hit you in the ass . you hide behind your religious hypocrisey in order to steal and embezzle as much as you can .
mismatch25: anybody know where iron felix ( felix dzerzhinsky ) is at these days ? sounds like something he would have done . lol what a mess
mismatch26: one solution would be to simply not come here illegally and follow the legal route to citizenship .
mismatch27: i must say ... . i actually did not know about this . glad i follow this page .
mismatch28: if you mean harm then you would be correct .
mismatch29: this from the self-absorbed dunce who helped elect trump . eabod

post: democrats are taking a winning moral issue ( not separating children from parents ) and turning it into a losing
comm0: you mean russia is going to attack our democracy again & amp ; the gop will help them so
comm1: jeff sessions lied to america saying separating kids was the law . it was not . it was an ill
comm2: this is a `` repeal & amp ; replace '' situation prompted by elite ice agents who strictly pursue smugglers & amp ;
comm3: whole border nonsense is political expediency . no one 's against legal immigration & amp ; to allow this
comm4: if you deal at all with terrorized immigrant communities , ice *is* a moral issue . what you 're

mismatch9: we are from from losing control ... gee you must have been a nice guy at some point in your life ..
mismatch10: who loves it no one else besides you idiots love him so keep dreaming dumbass !
mismatch11: they did . but they did not separate infants , toddlers and children from their parents unless it was absolutely clear that the child was in danger .
mismatch12: i ’ m sorry i can ’ t shed a tear for this child when true american children are hurting everyday over what they ’ ve brought into our country
mismatch13: you 're as dopey as your treasonous president . stay dumb , ignorant and bigoted at your own peril ... maybe you will learn a lesson the hard way ...
mismatch14: jesus was crucified for disobeying a 'law of the land ' .
mismatch15: you can keep labeling me but it does n't help your argument lol what a time to be alive .
mismatch16: john mccain ! quit already ! you are not working and should not be taking up a senate space !
mismatch17: thats right , instantly deport them , catch and release in their native land . fixes that problem ! next !
mismatch18: so does that mean you 're separating immigrant children from their parents & amp ; internment camps ?
mismatch19: fakenewsmedia trump wishes he was rocket man and have every one now
mismatch20: how about you act like a reporter and ask these ladies how they felt when their husbands did the exact same thing ? ? ?
mismatch21: no it is not ! ! ! it is a sign that he is not budging on the issue ! !

comm3: problem is not her . i think the dnc really messed up when endorsing candidates in the 2016
comm4: when a trump supporter uses hillary as their excuse to vote for the biggest mistake in us

mismatch1: please tell me where anyone said anything close to that .
mismatch2: a5 : attitudinal change to start with . recognition for the work s/he does engagors
mismatch3: as creatives we can have lots of passions so it feels natural to take the time to settle into a niche .
mismatch4: i really hope all exo members enlist at the same time . so then we will only have to wait for 2 years .
mismatch5: one of the first thing sessions did was rescind obama ’ s policy stopping the use of private

post: instead of blaming the law enforcement agencies , ice or border patrol , why not blame the parents for actually breaking the law ?
comm0: leftists are looking at the growing prison population and thinking that cell
comm1: save your left preaching & amp ; insulting our potus trump , playing guilt trips or having hypocritical
comm2: what kind of parent would put their kid in a dangerous situation like that ? some send their kid
comm3: sneaking into a country doesn ’ t make you an any more than breaking into a
comm4: seeking asylum at the border is legal !
comm5: instead of blaming the law enforcement agencies , ice or border patrol , why not blame the parents
comm7: in the legal field we call that `` personal responsibility '' for one 's detrimental actions
comm8: that is like blaming a rape victim for jay walking on the way to the police station to report a
comm9: why not look at this way their is only one place to put the blame on the dumb parents we have 30
mismatch0: what about the american children who are crying for their parents who have died from all the drugs or are incarcerated because they broke their law .
mismatch1: people who cross the border illegally are not immigrants ; they 're criminals | they should be prosecuted to to the fullest extent of the law . full stop .

mismatch6: so , by you must mean weaponized law enforcement wing of the democrat thanks for clearing that up . yes , trump is definitely guilty of redefining it .
mismatch7: first , the people guarding babies are not border patrol agents . secondly , how 's the cocaine habit ?
mismatch8: darling , you are the problem .

mismatch10: liberal democrats think they can get away with breaking the law arrest both the mayor of austin and the mayor of new york city .
mismatch11: wow ! ! so perfect
mismatch12: there is the discovery that border patrol has been blocking ports of entry . which is illegal . so
mismatch13: onus on parents . they know the policy , but try to enter anyway .
mismatch14: just to be clear : you are calling for congress to change the law , not for the executive branch to violate current law , right ?
mismatch15: the vote leave campaign was corrupt , from the breaking of electoral law to individuals taking
mismatch16: let 's hope it 's for the better because right now it 's looking a lot like a concentration camp .
mismatch17: you 're just a puppet , you can not think by yourself , you are the antithesis of being american
mismatch18: maybe their parents shouldn ’ t break the law . they need to think about their kids first . don ’ t break the law ! !
mismatch19: perhaps mueller knows the truth if thus ? i hope someone can reign trump in . it is not right that he can be above the law !
mismatch20: they aren ’ t blaming him for the laws ; they ’ re blaming him for his own actions .
mismatch21: here we go again ... selective enforcement of law . dangerous path .
mismatch22: or being under the weather , or above the law .
mismatch23: the parents or caretakers of 2,600 children broke the law and sacrificed their well being for a
mismatch24: same thing that was happening under your idol obama but the msm kept it quiet

mismatch27: trump needs to find a way to get these kids back to their families in mexico . either send them all back or see if they have other family .

mismatch1: i ’ m thinking of the same thing . going there and walking in wearing a trump t-shirt and maga hat !
mismatch2: oh yeah amazon\ 's going to be out of business
mismatch3: at least vote only gop during 2018 and 2020. a super gop majority in senate and house will be a great american step toward the `` right '' direction .
mismatch4: 1,000 's of sealed indictments will do that do you . heh
mismatch5: sadly unless he is convicted of an offence which carries a jail term of more than a year or is

mismatch22: anyone that wants the benefits of living in america , regardless of skin color ,
mismatch23: where are the hits point them out to me
mismatch24: you missed a trick by not making one of the os the spidey symbol like in homecoming .
mismatch25: she\ 's on the side that will get votes only does not care about you . she\ 's in it for herself like all the other government bums .

comm3: how was he supposed to do anything about the children at the border without a majority . you know the
comm4: you must not confirm a justice who would never be willing to indict a sitting president ! we must have
comm5: hey fake indian is done with dems sick agenda
comm6: you even have a better chance in a dna test than winning this one redwave
comm7: are you inciting violence again , democrats ?
comm8: then you better make sure your corrupted democrat friends do n't let their greed get the best of them and vote for him .
comm9: bring your bow and arrow ?
comm10: let ’ s face it . he could ’ ve named mother theresa to the court and you ’ d still bitch about it .
mismatch0: the dude doesn\'t even live in ny . that\ 's why it\ 's hard for him to show up .
mismatch1: alive , but i am sure they will feel worse than me . thank you !
mismatch2: obvious , it\ 's such a waste to even prosecute this guy because he will get away with it
mismatch3: first of all , he\ 's stupid . but even if it weren\'t a part of the u.s. , what of it were a vacation souiviner shirt ?
mismatch4: it 's labour putting a policy forward that they wo n't have to put into action ... .. just so that they can say the tories failed to do it
mismatch5: i don\'t like how thin that line is . why does it have to be a thin line ? why can\'t it be thick/thicc ?
mismatch6: all we need to do now is have a manual recount and introduce the senate
mismatch7: hey song - i thought about that too . but i think he wants us to do it on our own .
mismatch8: didn ’ t bother him ... it was feckless because he had to look up the meaning .
mismatch9: ... both leaders used it to promote themselves and both will put the most favorable propagandist spin on it that they can .

mismatch15: i never did say it was anyone ’ s fault i just asked you to leave me tf alone
mismatch16: what will it take to get this passed and acted on ? what can i do ? my senators already support it .
mismatch17: we need a third political party ... that represents the majority of us ... .not the extremes on both sides !
mismatch18: money and profit are at the crux of the matter but to say it outright is frowned upon in academia .

comm4: ice is rock solid . democrats are in deep shit .
comm5: blue lives matter - ice is enforcing the laws congress voted into law . whose fault are these laws - congress even the liberals who are crying for illegals .
comm6: they are giving president trump the 2020 election on a silver platter .
mismatch0: grow up and stop writing sticks and stones tweets . start solving problems not creating them !
mismatch1: they were against it before they were for it or were they for it before they were against it ? i can ’ t keep up with them .
mismatch2: vote for the candidate not the party . the swamp stinks with both the democrats and the republicans . time for term limits dismantle the old political machine .
mismatch3: this is a deflective narrative technique . real issue now is new policy change
mismatch4: your beginning to sound like some tweeny having a fight with your friends . petty beyond reason , juvenile and vengeful , even for a tweeny .

mismatch22: i agree with you , if anybody is doing corrupt things . should be handle accordingly ... .anybody ! thanks
mismatch23: this whole episode has really revealed how the right is consumed by a venomous , festering hatred of outsiders .
