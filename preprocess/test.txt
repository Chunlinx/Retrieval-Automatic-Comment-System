comm2: no but they did support the khmer .
comm3: no one is denying that . but we can hardly say we were better . there is no `` winner '' in this .

comm0: the three j ’ s . amigos to destroy our democracy .
comm1: i guess it all depends on how one defines democracy . apparently to the obama administration overthrowing a duly elected president is democratic .
comm2: they want us to believe that we are a democracy when in fact we are a constitutional republic
comm3: we had no idea how right was when he said 2016 election was completely rigged against djt
comm4: every one on the left can take that democracy bull shit , and shove it up their collective asses . because that is where it
comm5: when they say they actually mean they believe that the american people put them in power permanently and that trump stole what was rightfully theirs .
comm6: they have a totally different definition of `` democracy '' than the rest of america . the dems always say `` our democracy '' to distinguish the two .
comm7: and they still lost a rigged election ...
mismatch0: yes they are , you are a liar
mismatch1: i think it 's stop before you are full

mismatch1: miss her so much , especially this week .

comm2: `` make america great '' ; `` three items to save our democracy ''
comm3: no . but it 's a start . you have to take the shredded tire off before you put the new one on .
comm4: it 's at least a start . those who would destroy our democracy must be held accountable for their actions . we must protect our country !
comm5: replacing him with hillary , who actually won , would help 100 % .
comm6: but it sure will put america back on the path to democracy !
comm7: how many of the people on this thread actually vote in every election ? including the city and state elections ?
comm8: and trump 's election has shown us how many problems were lurking beneath the surface before he encouraged them to emerge .

mismatch7: illegal immigration is simply a way to keep the cost of labor artificially low .
mismatch8: has sold out our national security for $ 500,000,000 loan to and chinese trademarks for why not report that
mismatch9: we only have a problem enforcing the laws . that 's what we elected trump for , enforce the law and immigration is fixed .
mismatch10: most of us really learn when we suffer , through our own experience or from the experience of others . if you voted for trump , be prepared
mismatch11: no . but it 's a start . you have to take the shredded tire off before you put the new one on .
mismatch12: i agree it ’ s about our democracy it ’ s a fight for but at this point in time putin/trump is winning - divide and conquer
mismatch13: and all of the real patriotic americans who want our veterans provided for , and who support our constitution , which is what you 've fought for .

comm5: tough shit , dummy . maybe pay attention next election .
comm6: was well known before the election he was a conman . no sympathy for anyone who has buyers remorse . shame on them for ignoring the obvious
mismatch0: let me translate , he can fire who he wants !
mismatch1: the notion that he who shall not be named believes he is worthy of the office of the president is absurd on its face .
mismatch2: yep . will he finally face an actual consequence for his actions ? anyone ? anyone ? mueller ? mueller ?
mismatch3: trump is amazing . does everything he said he would and more . ca n't wait to vote for him again in 2020 !

comm2: how do i retweet this but it is over on election now unless there is way to reverse .
comm3: blockbuster would have been before the election . this is filled with far too much deflection on their behalf .
comm4: it should have devastated his campaign given the atrocities that the trump team committed . they shattered our democracy and a complicit media gave a big assist .
comm5: nyt sat on all of this information before the election .
mismatch0: republicans have spent years on investigations . leave mueller alone . watergate took two years .
mismatch1: if he had ejected the current mod team quietly , nuked everything , and then sat on the subreddit
mismatch2: the media would whip up the scare story that if we stayed in the eu , we would have to accept the euro and schengen .
mismatch3: proof that there are angels on earth .

comm2: even if they had , what would he have to worry about if everything was legal and done by the rules ?
comm3: of course it ’ s being disputed . time will prove what actually happened . a sitting government tried to influence the election . guess which one .
comm4: trump is a danger to our democracy . take heed . stay vigilant and call him out every time he lies . every single time .
comm5: except it is true , and they admitted to it . treason is a crime , even if your party lost the election .
mismatch0: really , anne ? there is a list a mile long of his achievements ... why not give him credit for that ? !

comm1: during this allegedly unarmed protest , there were : - 4 separate instances of shooting towards
comm2: well sure but ... why was a baby at a protest involving people storming a razor wire fence ?
comm3: why do you think there was a baby or even children anywhere near that conflict in the first
comm4: it was netanyahu that invited hamas to bring molotov cocktails and human shields to the party ? you really are an idiot .

mismatch12: and the children are still locked away in texas , why is no one talking about this .
mismatch13: as for the 'lie ' of protesting being an act of violence ' . the lie here

comm4: cynthia , our revolution candidates lose . you just signed your fate in the election . they might be a loud group but they are very small and toxic .

post: is that right ? you ’ re an idiot . and a moron .
comm0: you are n't smarter than benjamin franklin . `` democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on lunch . '' we are a constitutional republic .
comm1: says the moron that doesn ’ t know the difference between a democracy and a republic .
comm2: name calling ? nice that will definitely help show just how astute you are . especially when
comm3: we 're a constitutional republic , democratic but not a democracy .
comm4: and also , america is a `` republic , '' not a `` democracy ''
comm5: that ’ s the magas response anytime you say that our country is a democracy . i ’ ve seen it many times .
mismatch0: i don ’ t always agree with everything that trump says , but i disagree more with people who say that his
mismatch1: you sir , with all due disrespect are an idiot ! ! !
mismatch2: kriss , you should n't call your mammy a fraud and a moron , it 's self evident .

post: the accusations turn out to be true about this asset this will be the first time ever in american history
comm0: provide just one , single , fact proving that it was political . you ca n't , because it
comm1: let 's examine your scenario . if they were trying to `` infiltrate us '' ( like for decades ) ,
comm2: i think it ’ s hilarious that so many republicans believe that president obama sent a spy
comm3: so let me get this straight . obama colluded with the fbi to put a spy in the trump
comm4: i think it ’ s hilarious that so many republicans believe that president obama sent a spy
comm5: i think it ’ s hilarious that so many republicans believe that president obama sent a spy
comm6: yeah *if* the accusations ( made by trump supporters w/o evidence ) turn out to be true ...
mismatch0: it supposed to be free all the time
mismatch1: when did trump take a vacation . he takes an afternoon once in a while to play golf ... .fake news as always
mismatch2: for what crimes , dingleberry ? unlike potus , they 're not even being investigated .
mismatch3: mixed something up there , croatia will be the second game not first
mismatch4: it shouldnt be in the game in the first place , both women or men . doa series was never about this type of graphics violence
mismatch5: this is the first time in my exposure to the history of rank in the military , police etc that i
mismatch6: who would have ever thought that turning america against the fbi , corrupting our justice system and saying you can pardon yourself would anger anyone ?
mismatch7: trump is a professional liar so he fits in perfect with the republican party .
mismatch8: there can ’ t be just a the these scumbags in the administration need to face jail time . they ’ ve done too much harm this time .
mismatch9: president trump has kept his promises despite a totally hostile media
mismatch10: are we taking bets on how long it takes before her administration is arrested for corruption ?
mismatch11: if that 's true why are we required to pay for car insurance ? ?
mismatch12: so it really happened ? if it is on the internet it must be true .
mismatch13: if i promise to crap in your front yard , then i keep my promise , should i be admired for keeping my promise ?
mismatch14: they just can ’ t help themselves . they will never give him any credit for all the good he ’ s doing !
mismatch15: heartbreaking & this should be enough for mueller to throw the bums out
mismatch16: haha guess i 'll have to wait a loooooooong time to watch this info come to life
mismatch17: where is the damn oig report ? it was to be out this month .
mismatch18: the only time this nation will be better off is when 45 is no more one way or the other
mismatch19: and unfortuantly so has fox news and trump ... not that they ever had much to begin with
mismatch20: do we the people really think gives a flying f # * & what msm says or thinks ?
--------------------------------------------
post: look at all the abuses trump is committing and remind yourself that his base will vote for him again . no serious
comm0: absolutely correct . register , vote , educate , & donate . no point in wasting time and energy on the trump base .
comm1: 100 % true . its like a deranged reality show hosted from the wh . makes for uncomfortable yet addictive viewing ...
comm3: i have seen but what other ways can we help turn out especially for those targeted for suppression tactics ?
comm4: this is what stacey abrams is doing in georgia .
comm5: i have full confidence in democrats that they will fuck this up again .
comm6: also remember : majority rule via the vote is not their friend , and they know it . the last thing they want is free and fair elections .
mismatch0: and among madrasas probably less than 4 % teach hatred for the nation and fellow nationals . but again , look at the perception created .
mismatch1: nah just need to maintain the 2nd amendment in all 50 states . that is all that is needed to protect yourself and family from the emotionally disabled left .
mismatch2: one serious question . will you vote for impeachment if and when evidence is presented that shows pres trump was aware of a conspiracy with russians to win election ?
mismatch3: nice did you make the base as well ?
mismatch4: my children all had dummies and if you want your child to have one that\ 's your business and no one else\ 's .
mismatch5: restating putin ’ s words isn ’ t agreement by president trump . he said he believes in his intel people
mismatch6: there is no defense . none . it is inhumane and abuses children . no defense .
mismatch7: oh would you look at that , on the left is a classy lady and on the right bozo the cliwn .
mismatch8: just type his name in google and all you 'll see is articles of his death where they use many different photos of him that are n't his mugshot
mismatch9: i expect trump will pick will pick a justice that vote on his ideals . not good for the country .
mismatch10: po 'd all of north america and at least half of the rest of the world .
mismatch11: it is not illegal to present yourself at the border and ask
mismatch12: will that benefit putin if the answer is yes then 45 is all for it
mismatch13: get a life . no one cares . we will elect him again . take that to the bank .
mismatch14: senate ? ! jfc , this dim bulb should be wearing a helmet at all times for his own safety , and you want him in the senate ? ?
mismatch15: he calls them fake news and gaslights the country ... and they follow him around like puppies . wtf is happening ? ? !
mismatch16: i love that you can laugh and make fun of yourself !
mismatch17: more shocking is the white house , trump and most importantly trump ’ s lawyers allowing him to continue to speak publicly with his foot in his mouth .

mismatch5: praise be to god , i receive and pray to almighty god for another chance , amen
mismatch6: how is ms-13 is a racist ? they are dangerous criminals
mismatch7: most criminals take their families to jail with them.. you ’ re right
mismatch8: by not separating the children they would have to whiteness their parents being processes as criminals .
mismatch9: proof please ! you should of had a better candidate than hillary . the clinton ’ s are criminals .

mismatch20: amen i receive and proclaim success in all my modules
mismatch21: that ’ s a blatant lie , sputnik . but if you want to talk about removing dangerous criminals , this would be a good place to
mismatch22: probably and other criminals , but seems to pardon all the crooks .
mismatch23: the next presidential election ( if trump lasts that long ) is going to be a train wreck
mismatch24: looks more like the studio audience of price is did trump remember to remind them to spay and neuter their pets ?
mismatch25: amen ... i receive in jesus christ name ... am taking over by fire by force and it is done

mismatch0: he did not apologize , he gave excuses . there ’ s a difference

comm5: indicted for what ? hillary clinton ’ s campaign collided with a foreign entity to produce the dossier - wasn ’ t that to sway the election ?

comm0: could someone please tell me on what basis you think trump could be impeached on . you people need medication
comm1: impeachment at this time is the only way to save this democracy its institutions the rule of law ...
comm2: it should not be the strategy there is much more here . but the voters should know that voting for dems will save our country and democracy .
comm3: please please please run on impeachment and please do it . the republicans will win every election for the next century .
comm4: you actually need a reason to impeach , not winning the election is not one . neither is being the best president since reagan
comm5: it ’ s not the party ’ s strategy it ’ s people ’ s this is beyond an election , it is a mission to save our democracy .
comm6: what a hilarious headline trump is not getting impeached . this is just another one of the mechanisms to thwart an honest election .
comm7: yeah let 's impeach the potus because he won the election ! even though we now know the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign ! tic toc
comm8: yes people want to know something is going to be done ... . we can not hide behind thoughts of it will make
mismatch0: when you are finished there , please come help us in south carolina . we have pockets of democrats that are dying to turn the state blue !

mismatch4: all we can do it vote vote vote and hope the numbers are big enough to offset election tampering . also
mismatch5: out of interest how has trump doing exactly what he promised to do in his campaign to became
mismatch6: no . increased competition in higher education in the uk has failed to drive down prices . there are other factors in play . got it ?
mismatch7: which party cheated one of their own out of his chance to become president ? and has an impeached president in the last 25y ?
mismatch8: eu citizens are allowed to vote in the local election and not be allowed in the general election . the libdem only got the eu citizens vote .
mismatch9: the problem is n't numbers , it 's that the candidates have n't been good enough to convince independents to vote for them
mismatch10: just in time to vote for trudeau in the next election
mismatch11: bs , thanks to you all who gave him a free pulpit for ratings , trump trump trump trump , is there any other news out there ?
mismatch12: trump is 1 ( in a poll to determine worst president since wwii ) . will he brag about it ?
mismatch13: to be fair , having a higher chance of embracing the sweet release of death could be seen as a privilege to some .
mismatch14: funny how they skyrocketed under obama and insurance companies were fleeing aca . you can fool some people chuck but its people like you that made me switch parties .
mismatch15: i 've almost been wishing i could temporarily move back to toronto just so i could not vote for ford . that family makes me sick .
mismatch16: trump should be impressed with the numbers of the crowd !
mismatch17: but will this be enough to motivate the blue wave that is desperately needed ?
mismatch18: did you speak out when the previous administration did the same thing at higher the numbers ?
mismatch19: he 's clearly the worst within my lifetime , and i 'm 66 .
mismatch20: not good news for those folks
mismatch21: i agree . but potential definitions of the term he used could include anything from chattel slavery to
mismatch22: impeachment is a political bomb for the democrats . just go to congress and fight for progressive polices .
mismatch23: i bet there glad about that , as next season they could get a higher position in there league and maybe get into the champions league .
mismatch24: the least he could do is house them in his trump hotels
mismatch25: they ’ ve been brought up to believe their lives and thoughts are more important than anyone else ’ s
mismatch26: i think he 'd be unable to speak if he could not lie .

comm2: you sir , are a threat to democracy !
comm3: we can ’ t expect a fakepresident who is soooo unqualified , to be in washington ,
comm4: they should have exposed the investigation to the american people prior to election day .
comm5: he just do n't want the to meddle in his election campaign scams .
comm6: for a person who `` won '' the election you are certainly obsessed with something that happened during the campaign . methinks you doth protest too much .

comm0: honestly joe what fbi did to interfere with our election in this country is a lot more worrisome than what russians did in my opinion
comm1: please remember what obama said trump better except the outcome of the election ! so he and we did ! so what are you babbling about ?
comm2: there is n't proof russia did anything . your over the top defense of anything remotely critical of the fbi is really something .
comm3: joe , in simple , plain terms , state what exactly you allege russia 'did ' to this country .
comm4: is it the fbi ’ s job to spy on a campaign ?
mismatch0: au contraire ... not compelling him to testify demeans our country before the world . in our system , no one should be above the law .

comm4: breaking : republican senate panel confirms putin worked to help trump win election . huge .

mismatch3: virginia is lost and is a blue state solidly . the dc influence overwhelms the rest of the state .
mismatch4: my heart breaks for him as a little boy .
mismatch5: we need here in the central states oh . our people are killed by unknown gun
mismatch6: isn\'t that illegal . i think it is a law that the president must have someone with him in all meetings with heads of state from other countries .
mismatch7: people will be celebrating in the streets when trump is booted out of office .
mismatch8: huckabee son kills dogs for fun the only passage he needs to read is of church and state

mismatch13: we the people of south-east welcome you sir to ebonyi state , 99.99 % votes from south-eastern states
mismatch14: stop embarrassing our state with your lies and photo ops..here 's a statement from little girls fathet
--------------------------------------------
post: this is disgusting . how is this acceptable ? and how are we expected to take any of these publications seriously
comm0: do you think we 've forgotten the years you 've spent as the pretty face of white
comm1: the fact you added roseanne to your tweet shows you support and making the case to
comm2: megyn kelly waited until after the election to tell her story so she could sell
comm3: if you do n't know , you will never get that hating corruption & amp ; racism are two completely different things .
comm4: do n't agree with yourself on this one , megan ! if everything were all so `` cut and
mismatch0: i hope you are listening to all of our voices and how against this tax bill we are . we vote you into
mismatch1: i wonder how many of these people are going to lose their jobs at the bmw plant thanks to this guy they are cheering ?
mismatch2: not agreeing or disagreeing with this , but how exactly do you know any of this , considering they ’ re - yunno - undocumented ?
mismatch3: i think about 70 % of waters votes are fraud . i mean seriously , how in the world does this woman get so many votes .
mismatch4: it ’ s shameful how many are actually offended this is a quality joke
mismatch5: trump 2020 is in the bag
mismatch6: maybe because we live in a democracy that values freedom of speech that ’ s why they
mismatch7: i really believe your words . but how long can the ppl take this continuous pain ?
mismatch8: come on . racist did n't work . the moved to nazi . i will call them `` mierda '' .

post: drug prices in the u.s. are among the highest in the world because politicians like trump refuse to stand up to
comm0: i would be interested in reading the bills you introduced which would lower drug prices . which bill numbers are they ?
comm1: president donald trump is making big promises to reduce prescription drug costs .
comm2: it 's easy to talk from the side but what have you done to reduce prices ?
comm3: citizens united is destroying america one election at a time .
comm4: because corrupt is probably getting kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies for higher prices . a crook is a crook is a crook .
comm5: the democrats had a president called obama for 8 years he did nothing about prescription drug prices which were skyrocketing under his administration .
mismatch0: do n't act like you care about our veterans when you are leaving the entire future of the va up in the air , without anyone to lead it .
mismatch1: if the babies go back to the cages , trump should be in one of them !
mismatch2: sounds like you are describing your taxscam you screw over the poor at every opportunity , dick .
mismatch3: wow , pick up a political history book ... .you embarrass yourselves .
mismatch4: nope-not true - wages are stagnant -gas prices are
mismatch5: easy because even if you 're to tell the story it 's not difficult to tell . at the end of the day you 're just the victim .
mismatch6: no . increased competition in higher education in the uk has failed to drive down prices . there are other factors in play . got it ?
mismatch7: deregulated energy is the way to go . when additional companies come in to compete , the prices go down . nv electric bills are high .
mismatch8: ... and all because of the greed of human kind .
mismatch9: just like mass shootings in the us get publicised and more shooters
mismatch10: rudy is the best thing that ever happened to trump in the worse way .
mismatch11: we breed the next batch of terrorists . that 's what this amounts too . it is cruel and ridiculous .
mismatch12: it nice to see there are people who will stand up for the injustices that are being done !
mismatch13: they have the right to refuse service to anyone !
mismatch14: that ’ s shameful my family 3 genations that i know of fought to prevent that
mismatch15: our country is founded in laws . nobody enters america illegally .
mismatch16: pressure is in play . real question is what the utility curve looks like . how elastic are p9 prices to their remaining audience ?
mismatch17: yeah maybe sometimes they need video replay but then that would just get abused .
--------------------------------------------
post: . @ padres if this is the product during the process , how about lowering prices and filling the empty seats ? why
comm0: when they ’ re terrible the price stays the same , but once they start getting good the price will sky rocket .
comm1: at least lower the beer price
comm2: one of the reasons i haven ’ t gone this season . way too expensive . if i do it will be through stubhub all the way
comm3: nice half price toyota terrace infield tix at costco .
comm4: wont happen . then when they start playing better , they 'll raise prices .
mismatch0: and that 's only because the name of the game is love thy enemy and not `` join in on their bitterness ''
mismatch1: and this is how broke the internet
mismatch2: so where and how is this happening exactly ?
mismatch3: anyone know where can i dwld bv s2 + behind cam ? i cant find the work link , help me army : ( (
mismatch4: in the 1950 ’ s kruschev said he would bury america from the inside and trump is doing it # traitor
mismatch5: weird . but then again , they should be thankful to be able to fly in the first place .
mismatch6: do n't worry , corey will serve at the ball sack of satan for eternity .
mismatch7: the mueller team ’ is not really how this works .
mismatch8: how is this possible when the media insists the opposite is true ?
mismatch9: so this is how the death star first became funded .
mismatch10: wrong is wrong no matter the politics
mismatch11: he is ( alleged ) profiting from all this as are others in this administration , shocking i know !
mismatch12: it is the dems law ... how the fuck is this wrong ? ? ?
mismatch13: `` this is why i am thinking about getting more tee shirts from the gasoline station ''
mismatch14: man got short term memory loss on his way to dementia

post: trump is blaming his own inhumane border policy on democrats
comm0: it ’ s always somebody else ’ s fault with this guy
comm1: his own inhumane policy ? really ? where do you live ? in cambodia ? do you not see whats going on ? ? ? ? ?
comm2: blame it on his huge butt .
comm3: everyday i feel like jesse at the end of breaking bad , 'he cant keep getting away with it ! ! ! '
comm4: he 's the master of fake news . blames everyone except the one who is actually guilty , himself .
comm7: god are you for real ? ! ? can it be more idiotic article written by you than this ? derangement syndrome at its best
mismatch0: he admits to controlling that media that blasts white supremacists while extolling his supremacist race . always blaming others for what you are yourself .
mismatch1: rosanne barr , did n't pass jim crowe laws the democrats did that all on there own !
mismatch2: keep in mind that the governors of most states are republicans ... and , mine is anxiously awaiting pence & trump to campaign with him :
mismatch3: hardline federal policy is worth undermining , it ’ s worth sabotaging in a host of ways . and an underground railroad for migrants would do just
mismatch4: of course not.. because everything on the border is working just fine without a border wall.. chaos
mismatch5: likely also about getting people to focus on anything other than russia .
mismatch6: where are they blaming the victim ?
mismatch7: something else ironic , is that mexico has a border wall on it 's southern border ...
mismatch8: we all need to do this ! now to research how . then we need to actually drive people to the polls !
mismatch9: fellow senators , take note . this is how you lead . thank you senator for being there on the ground and getting to the bottom of things .
mismatch10: melanoma lies , too peas in a pod
mismatch11: it is unacceptable that we as a nation have to think about a big baby ’ s fragile ego while he ’ s putting little kids in cages . resigntrump
mismatch12: and it was an obama policy therefore it must be undone , because trump is jealous and petty .
mismatch13: do n't excuse this man 's tyranny and atrocities by blaming mental illness . this man is evil , plain and simple .
mismatch14: it ’ s about evil . he is evil .
mismatch15: blaming everything on obama is akin to adults blaming parents for things they can
mismatch16: this is so hard ... omg ! ! ! ! listen to children who ’ ve just been separated from their parents at the border
mismatch17: those conditions are not mutually exclusive .

mismatch3: yet only the canadians deserve `` a special place in hell '' ?
mismatch4: is there no end to the hillary saga ? i only have so many tears to spare . sighhhhhhhhhhhh

post: trump admin has still done nothing to investigate russian hacking of us election in an effort to prevent future
comm0: russia didn ’ t hack the election .
comm1: good thing obama knew that was happening before the election and did nothing ... .right ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
comm2: when you 've had success stealing an election with an enemy state ... .why would you try and change it with 30 % base ?
comm3: hm . `` hacking of us election '' . i thought they hacked the dnc . two different things .
comm4: geeze kirsten , how many russian election investigations do you want ? enough is enough !
comm5: russia did not hack our election . there were no votes changed
mismatch0: try and stay on topic , trump with the help of foreign money and deceit stole the election . his presidency should be null and void .
mismatch1: andrew ryan from bioshock , ill have mr. house on my next post ; )
mismatch2: because neither has done a single thing in 18 months to stop gun violence ! ! !
mismatch3: putin influenced the election of trump . brazil has influenced in two elections for president of the united
mismatch4: you are still absolutely derelict in your duty to stop russia from hacking our next election .
mismatch5: yes , trumps opioid effort has devastated communities across the country . you might want a 4th grader proof reading your copy .
mismatch6: seems i remember trump asking russia to interfere . how he loved wiki leaks
mismatch7: what has done in the past to make him flee russia ?
mismatch8: trump has to let her out of her box once and a while
mismatch9: you must be due . everything you ’ ve done to date has backfired in spectacular fashion . haha
mismatch10: he thinks due process is how the grass gets wet in the early morning .
mismatch11: electoral act says that after proclamation , the elections should be held under the conditions which were in place at the time of such a proclamation .
mismatch12: 8 years to do what trump has done in 19 months .
mismatch13: why ? what if more evidence surfaces that russia was involved in election fixing ? this seems kinda stupid , but trump just has to play the victim
mismatch14: i live in golden and have season tickets . im not an outsider ... lol
mismatch15: even more of an embarrassment than i originally thought .

mismatch6: gee , you guys called obama 's faster growth `` weak . '' and dt did n't have to fix the gop horror obama had to fix
mismatch7: unionists using & threatening violence to undermine democracy ? certainly wouldnt be a first . the 6 counties was founded on such a threat .
mismatch8: drumpf is such an ignorant shit
mismatch9: the court has a very valuable role to play . but that role is a supplement to , a complement to , democracy . it
mismatch10: you do understand this program was set up years ago and the dhs is following rhe same rules they did under obama

post: i do n't want to burst any bubbles but just because we are americans , it does n't make us smarter than the rest of the world .
comm0: if this last election has proven anything it is proven that a large percentage of americans are extremely stupid

comm2: the last election proved it
comm3: 2020 election are important in the too near future . we need to have a clear choice opponent that challenge trumpism that 's affecting our country .
comm4: this has been proven when our election system elevated trump .
comm5: with the election of the that 's a given .
comm6: after the election of trump no one thinks americans are smart .
comm7: the election of gw bush and trump proves that we are not as smart as the rest of the world .
mismatch0: i will do so if most of the people want me to do so , i am sorry
mismatch1: you are hot i think they wan na keep you to themselves
mismatch2: wow that does sound scary ... i haven ’ t tried any of the considerably strong meds just the more

mismatch5: no , it begs the question of how many ppl in our lives are perpetrators but we just do n't know .
mismatch6: definitely , you should create a separate video of your own and we look forward to hearing what information you shared in ted talk .
mismatch7: yes yes we did and i have a feeling lots of us are willing to do it again . trump=idiot
mismatch8: so make them do it ... you are part of the government ...
mismatch9: may it take a bit longer time . we are also waiting eagerly . all the best acumen mr hashem .
mismatch10: those interest rates are insane . and like folks don ’ t go there easy . they don ’ t have options and it is garbage .
mismatch11: to control their freedom ? why does the administration act omnipotent ? what makes us greater than ?
mismatch12: wow of course north korea does not want to go to war - sanctions are lifted because you stated
mismatch13: big bucks are at stake !
mismatch14: correction : just because a person is the potus does not mean they are the leader of the free world . trump has proven that beyond a doubt .
mismatch15: exciting hope to see it soon
mismatch16: the rest of the world are getting a bit suspicious that your country isnt up to that particular job .
mismatch17: yes we get it , you stole the election with the help of russia ! donthecon
mismatch18: everything is happening way to fast and us good americans are going to be screwed !
mismatch19: i grew up seeing this very kind of thing . i thank god that this did not die with kenneth hagin 's generation .

post: imagine how mad trump would be at the fbi , if they had n't helped tip the election to him
comm0: maybe he 's pissed because they did tip the election . he never really wanted the job in the first place .
comm1: if the fbi wanted to tip the election to trump , would have recommended prosecution for hillary ’ s home brew server .
comm2: remember giuliani stupid grin in 2016 announcing the fbi newyork office had info on
comm3: seems like 10 years since trump was blowing kisses and embracing comey after the election .
comm4: `` if they had n't helped tip the election to him '' trump is very fortunate that his opponents refuse to learn from their defeats .
comm5: the only one that tipped the election his way was his corrupt , lazy , entitled opponent
mismatch0: somebody actually typed that with a straight face . i ca n't imagine how unbelievably pathetic their life must be if they think that .
mismatch1: if we only had would we have mj and lbj ? they both talk about how wanting to be the
mismatch2: and he said he would testified if they ask him to and they do n't need a subpoena
mismatch3: the fbi is coming thanks
mismatch4: if money had really mattered to him he would have been chilling
mismatch5: he probably made a deal to be on the liberal party ticket at the next election ...
mismatch6: but he has lowered taxes .
mismatch7: i 'm prob getting ahead of myself , but i have high hopes that her future wardrobe will
mismatch8: yes they would . deplorable
mismatch9: oh , and if sturgeon had any idea about the mood of the people she would n't have lost 21 seats and half a million votes at the last election
mismatch10: trump supporters are in a cult
mismatch11: well in this case they can not have both , because if they ate the food they were supposed to deliver they would be fired !
mismatch12: the conservatives say they use logic , but when you prove em wrong they say `` thats fake news ! '' or `` libtard lol ''
mismatch13: perhaps they could come and collect him at the curb .
mismatch14: in the words of peter hitchens . the tories would guillotine the queen in trafalgar square if they thought it would win them an election .
mismatch15: i wonder how they would act if they got to japan and were discriminated against .
mismatch16: after if they win the election they havent finished with the abc yet they 're a long way to go
mismatch17: i noticed that too ! the entire justice dept and the fbi need to be overhauled ! ! ! ! how dare they not follow the law ! ! !

post: is special counsel robert mueller going to investigate this ? chinese government officials reached out to
comm0: hillary lost . why do we care ? trump won , apparently with russian help . why are we not investigating
comm1: taking a meeting to talk policy is very , very different from taking a meeting to discuss how the foreign country can help one candidate win the election
comm2: i don ’ t think it ’ s illegal for a candidate or their representative to meet with
comm3: were they trying to influence the election with disinformation sent out to influence the stupid uneducated gop voters ? nope .
comm4: assange insists it wasn ’ t russia that interfered in our elections . it would be a shock
comm5: let us know when you have an email confirming the meeting took place and that china offered to interfere with the election on her
comm6: did they offer dirt on trump and ensure that xi wanted her to win the election ? no ? ok. stfu .
comm7: clinton email investigation : -2 yrs -0 indictments -0 convictions benghazi investigation : -4 yrs

mismatch12: this is what happens when your president is not beholden to special interest money . winning !
mismatch13: deep statism on display . need to flush all of our government agencies . it will take 20 years to flush these rats out of government .
mismatch14: it gets pretty out of hands . let 's put is this way there is an achievement for going
mismatch15: it is not going to end until the left gets rid of every conservative in this country , one way or another it is going to happen !
mismatch16: trump is beyond pathetic . all of his life he 's squirmed out of his bad deeds but this is going to end
mismatch17: what is this about ?

comm2: getting nervous are you ? typical lib projection , we know who was really colluding and she still lost a rigged election lmfao
comm3: so how exactly did the saudi ’ s seize power . by seize , you mean travel , campaign and win the election .
comm4: i guess there are some muslims who trump loves after all : the ones who helped him cheat in the election .
comm5: i am losing track of all the players but good god , there ’ s enough anecdotal evidence to nullify his election right
comm6: the main objective was/is seizing $ $ $ $ . doubt they dreamt they could win an honest election .
comm7: it 's not surprising that these acts are becoming public knowledge and the high probability
comm8: trump must be indicted . there has never been a greater threat to our democracy than trump . he must be punished as a traitor .
comm9: winning the election , to this family , was all about getting rich , not about the country or the american people !

post: immigrant toddlers are being ordered to appear in court alone for their deportation hearings , according to
comm0: did a piece on this a few weeks ago - it is legit ! these kids are ordered to
comm1: is this really acceptable ? honestly , ask
comm2: it 's a crime to require such a thing from anyone unable to understand and abide by this
comm3: toddlers in court ? and alone ? theyre out of their minds
comm4: we 've lost the democracy . it 's over people .
comm5: the obama administration has lost track of scores of immigrant children who have been
comm6: the aclu lost a case challenging this practice back in 2016 .
mismatch0: omg the sky is falling ! save it for the confirmation hearings lizzie where you\ 'll be on video being the shrill charlatan that you are .
mismatch1: it 's one thing to want the best for your child , but they know the laws and are using their kids as pawns .
mismatch2: example of honest leftist logic : obama was obviously a nazi and the over arching principles of his immigration policy are a throwback to 1933 ...
mismatch3: i do n't . gone to the movies alone many times . infact if i am really there for the movie i go alone .
mismatch4: hope they can get them out soon
mismatch5: ask the president to tell his mother 's story of being a victim of a hispanic immigrant

mismatch8: why is hhs getting a pass on informing us what they are doing with the children . where is the demand ?
mismatch9: yes he must clear his name on the court of law and if find guilty he must go to jail like any one who committed crime
mismatch10: hey man motherhood is the hardest job in the world according to them . except for the fact you can wear pajamas to work lol
mismatch11: sometimes as a journalist covering such heartbreaking stories eventually takes its toll . we are only human . identify
mismatch12: reality act time for all illegal immigrants ... .no trial just straight to deportation and no chance of becoming a legal citizen in the future maga
mismatch13: is n't separating babies & toddlers from their families more expensive ? why is n't mexico paying ? that was the promise .

mismatch16: got to do something quick . republicans want their pick in the court . no we ’ re going to
mismatch17: i rip all my blankets off and just sleep under a sheet lmao
mismatch18: there is no way this incompetent administration has devoted sufficient staff and resources to care for babies and toddlers . guaranteed they are warehousing those poor kids .
mismatch19: people who sleep under the covers in the blazing hot summer are braver than the us marines
mismatch20: so according to owaisi in order to save secularism hindu 's must also vote for hindu candidates . good suggestion by owaisi .

post: in his decades of faithful service on the bench , justice kennedy has been a man of integrity and decency . he has
comm0: what do you know of integrity ? you ’ re despicable .
comm1: as mitch did ... you will wait until the next election
comm2: let 's call it the garland standard . mcconnell said no scotus nominees in an election year .
comm3: mr. ryan , you and mcconnell set a precedent in 2016 by refusing to have a confirmation
comm4: and it 's to close to a election to replace him so just like the gop did so will the dems do
comm5: the republicans who threw up a wall to block dems from electing a judge for the supreme ct .
comm6: it 's funny that you think you know what integrity means .
comm7: you mean a puppet for you and good old mitch mcconnell
comm8: russian president . paul ryan you checked your integrity at the door when trump took office .
comm9: after the election of course . you already stole one .
mismatch0: matt bouillabaisse has a jam-packed schedule , filled with lots of important things like cashing dark money checks
mismatch1: jeez , that 's quite a load of bullshit you 're spewing there . `` human decency ? '' like what trump has shown people seeking asylum ?
mismatch2: lol he turned around and has his firearm on him too . lol too funny & amp ; cute !

post: something leftists don ’ t seem to understand : we were just as angry about obama ’ s presidency as you are about
comm0: exactly ! no matter if another republican had won they would have been in the streets with outrage
comm1: healthy economy ? people voted for trump because they wanted a healthy economy .
comm3: not really . i listened to the pretty speeches obama gave then trashed the country with his actions . i 'll take trump every single day .
comm4: that ’ s your problem then , you should listen to the foul , inappropriate things spilling from his mouth , it ’ s not presidential .
comm5: give examples . i ’ m waiting .
comm6: you actually just described obama ... trump is for all americans . wake up
comm7: it was n't comparable , that 's the problem . trump is working for the american people and obama ... ... ? ? ?
comm8: the left thought they had it in the bag & amp ; believed they were going to continue to turn america
comm9: exactly & amp ; they ca n't understand why trump supporters , ( conservatives ) are not going around being

mismatch9: i hope you will share this line of questioning with your former colleagues in hopes that they will pursue it !
mismatch10: i just heard about this . i don ’ t understand what i can do about this ?
mismatch11: stop talking about the millionaires . there aren ’ t that many . why aren ’ t you doing something to help
mismatch12: i ’ m assuming you don ’ t mean to be arguing that only those who are affected by a terrible government policy can legitimately question it .
mismatch13: you 're doing a good enough job to look as bad as possible without any external help . the leaks just confirm what we all are thinking
mismatch14: al ! get this to your senator friends and beg them to ask these questions ! albie wan , you ’ re our only hope !

comm0: can anyone show me where commentary ever wondered how we would pay for a 2.4
comm1: cut salaries of congress . that shld help .
comm2: we have tanks just sitting there unused but we keep buying more it 's bullshit , fuck the military industrial complex
comm3: the defense budget is fully funded . a 30 trillion dollar healthcare bill is not , so try again .
comm4: dems voted to raise the military budget while obama was in office too . another reason i hate both
mismatch0: congratulations we need a new word wide order ... good for israel ... we are waiting the same for venezuela
mismatch1: were we fighting just as hard for our democracy before trump ? did we pay attention to local elections or even
mismatch2: and how much of the taxpayers money did you spend on this trip and photo op ? i ’ m sure you didn ’ t pay for it .
mismatch3: if the germans could pay the jews , they can certainly pay the namibians ! this will be a great start for all reparations owed to africa ! hi
mismatch4: no doubt you and your uncle sanders share the same socialist agenda . you guys enjoy chanting free free but have no idea who will pay pay .
mismatch5: i wonder why we pay 3/4 . could it be that our military industrial complex demands
mismatch6: its refreshing having a president that backs the blue .
mismatch7: hoping his voice will inspire other conservatives of principle to be just as vocal in their criticism of what has become of the gop .
mismatch8: but the sheep in nyc will still re-elect him .
mismatch9: it 's not a handful of people defending the child camps cameron . it 's the entire republican party . every last one of them .
mismatch10: or pay them 1.5 billion to kill more us soldiers
mismatch11: ntsa has hijacked the role of traffic police . they are busy collecting bribes in a big way .the police have been overlooked
mismatch12: yes -- this . poetic !
mismatch13: i so agree ... hispanic actors should band together and refuse to portray these roles ... we need to humanize the portrayal of hispanic immigrants . thisisacrisis undocumentedlivesmatter
mismatch14: mexico will also when they lose funding and trade surpluses that will pay for the wall .

post: flash forward to november , 2020 : trump cancels the election because voters disagree with him
comm0: when members of congress object he had them arrested without trial and pardons himself and all involved
comm1: of course ... because `` they disagree with their president '' so the election is canceled ...
comm2: i intended it to be thought provoking , not funny
comm3: the proof of what is going to happen is they constantly accused obama of planning that .
comm4: unfortunately , this is entirely plausible and therefore , not funny .
comm5: there ’ s only 2 ways trump is leaving the white house - via an undertaker , or by armed arrest
comm6: only question left is whether he will take the title king or emperor .
comm7: it is very thought provoking . none are good .

mismatch15: yeah mary you should see how some of you talk to the rest of us or is that normal from trump voters
mismatch16: reading this brings tears to my eyes ... .so love hearing about people who are willing to give unselfishly .
mismatch17: more lies . the man is probably disgusted with himself for being a trump puppet .
mismatch18: if he starts crying over the election , smack him trump
mismatch19: 3200+ counties in america hillary won 52 of those . most of those 52 counties were from newyork & california smdh next . trump won the popular vote
mismatch20: you give him five seconds to talk and then you forgive him because he did a good thing but no more coming home with kids .
